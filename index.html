                        <p class="mb-4">Straying away from the typical superhero costume, how are costumes in real life paralleled? In the workforce, how does the suit enhance power? Why do some clothing types inherently bias perspective? Let's take a look at a couple articles and learn more about how the power of the suit has been molded into modern society.</p>

                                <p class="my-3 article"> There’s always been a sense of increased power when wearing a tux—no matter which gender—due to the ‘masculinity’ it portrays. In “Quirky Girl, Quirky Tux” trope’s case, wearing a tux re-invents a female character as rebellious, independent, and quirky. It's used to categorize the girl as ‘other’ or ‘weird’, which seems to differentiate from the common conception that women wear tuxedos to feel more masculine and powerful.</p>

                                <p class="my-3 mx-3 article" >It seems as if Dent is implying that the power of the suit has rendered powerless due to its diffusion beyond men’s clothing. This perspective is interesting because he implies that as more people wear tuxedos, the value of true power decreases. However, the approach Dent takes is just condescending because of the connection he makes between non-men and their lack of inability to fulfill the power a suit requires. </p>

                                <q><i>If, by chance, I find another person more suitable as a wife than the wife I already have, I want the liberty to replace my present wife with another one. Naturally, I will expect a fresh, new life; my wife will take the children and be solely responsible for them so that I am left free.</i></q>

                            <p>Brady's quote is not just the comparison of a man’s power versus a woman’s power, but how they intersect with each other. The presence of a man will reduce the validity of any woman in relation to him, such as in the case of Brady’s case where a husband can simply “replace my present wife with another one”. Furthermore, if we were to not even suggest Brady’s piece wasn’t from a man’s perspective, there’s still the idea that a woman’s job is to carry the burden of another’s needs.

                                    <q><i>Smiler attributes further distortions in masculinity to a century-long backlash against women’s rights. During World War I, women proved that they could keep the economy humming on their own, and soon afterward they secured the vote. Instead of embracing gender equality, he says, the country’s leaders “doubled down” on the inalienable male right to power, emphasizing men’s supposedly more logical and less emotional nature as a prerequisite for leadership.</i></q>

                                <p id="batmancaption">Batman/Bruce Wayne is the male superhero everyone wants to be—he’s extremely wealthy, driven, brooding, strong, and quite the inventor. Furthermore, Batman started out as a vengeful boy, violent in his actions and had no remorse, which is the stereotypical ‘bad boy’ image. In this particular comic, Kathy Kane aspires to be a hero like her cousin Bruce, but is shut down of her own desires because she’s a woman. While it's no surprise that these sexist ideas were prominent in the mid-1900s, the development of women as superheroes are still affected by these sexist upbringings.</p>

                                <q><i>I’ve spent a lot of time telling myself that men and women are fundamentally alike, mainly in the service of arguing that women should not only be permitted but be welcomed into a variety of positions and roles that only men occupied.</i></q>

                            <p>Quindlen’s quote is reminiscent of every fight for women’s rights throughout history. Not only the equal rights of men and women, but the fair treatment, opportunities, and unbiased perceptions. This can easily be applied to any power imbalance fueled by gender roles—superheroes, athletics, work. To illustrate, the addition of female superheroes wasn’t to empower them, but rather act as a sidekick, plot device, damsel in distress, and other demeaning roles. As Quindlen says, these characters are permitted but aren’t welcome.</p>
